# Project Title

Employee Directory

## How it works

- The page loads 12 random users by utiliizing the "https://randomuser.me/" API on startup.

- The search bar at the top can be used to filter the 'employees' by their first and last name.

- Clicking on an 'employee' opens up an overlay with additional information related to that 'employee'.
  
  - The overlay can be closed by either clicking the close button or anywhere outside the 'employee card'.
  
  - Navigating to the previous or the next 'employee' can also be done by clicking on the arrows on either side of the 'employee card'.   
    ###### _Currently you can the move from the last 'employee' to the first by clicking the next button and vice versa by clicking the previous button._

### Goal of the project

- To use an [API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab information and build a prototype employee directory for an imaginary startup.

- To familiarize working with Async JavaScript.

### Built With
